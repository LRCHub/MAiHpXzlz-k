[00:05.85] I keep on fear, keep on loathing
[00:09.49] Nothing brings it on, I keep on falling
[00:12.83] Decide what it is I cannot find
[00:19.37] It's subsides what you make it
[00:22.66] Never feel like you're gonna break it
[00:26.05] It's gonna be alright, alright
[00:41.05] 
[00:32.63] Sleep until the morning comes
[00:36.25] The sun will warm your soul
[00:38.54] Sleep until the morning comes for you, oh yeah
[00:46.10] 'Til the morning it's alright
[00:49.56] I can walk into the sunlight
[00:52.97] Into the day, into the day, to the day
[01:11.97] 
[01:06.01] I feel it falling, nothing comes to my mind
[01:10.48] Bring it on in a different tide
[01:12.96] I feel alright, alright now
[01:19.51] I feel strong, I feel rigid
[01:22.83] It's nothing to do with the vision
[01:26.11] Oh, feels so right, so right
[01:40.11] 
[01:32.37] Sleep on tight, sleep on tight
[01:45.99] Sleep until the sunlight
[01:52.79] Sleep until sunlight
[01:59.69] Sleep on tight, sleep on tight
[02:05.12] Sleep on tight
[02:12.12] 
[02:25.53] Sleep on tight, 'til the sunlight
[02:32.58] Sleep on tight, 'til the sunlight burns you happy
[02:41.96] 'Til the sunlight burns you happy
[02:46.04] 'Til the sunlight burns a happy hole in your heart
[02:52.20] In your heart
[02:59.29] In your heart
[03:06.12] In your heart
[03:12.58] In your heart
[03:19.35] In your heart
[03:25.92] In your heart
[03:32.42] 
[03:32.81] In your heart
[03:39.12] In your heart
[03:46.19] In your heart
[03:52.57] In your heart
