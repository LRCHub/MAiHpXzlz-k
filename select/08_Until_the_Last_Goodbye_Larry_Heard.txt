Heavy breathin'
Heart beat fast
Lightnin' struck me got me runnin' the tge sink feelin' nauseous
Turn a faucet on and off
And i cant figure out what caused it
Cant help but think
How? What? Why?
What did you do to my life?
Got me restless tryna find the missing pieces of the puzzle that you left behind
Leave it to me to figure it out
But i cant wash the stress off my face
No matter how many times i scrub
How many shots i drink
How many friends i love or lost
But most of all realize
I can never say goodbye
Cuz saying goodbye bye bye
Means going away
And going away means forgetting about you
(Dallas Green) So now youre not there
But your ghost still burns in the air
And finally above us the waves
Have come to take you away
And with this song
Ill say goodbye
And thank you for
What youve done to my life
And finally ill see you with love
I hope you will rest
In the stars above
And i dont understand what you died for
We still could have given so much more
Although you were something i could never be
I know youre still the watching over me
Now, now
Now, now i know
