This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I've grown a little older
Why is the pain much worse?

You look so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face?
Don't wanna spend the night and wake up
Realize you've made a big mistake
(Oh-oh-oh)

I can't refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
(Oh-oh-oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
(Oh-oh-oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old

And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
(Back, back, back)
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad
(Oh-oh-oh)

I can't t refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
(Oh-oh-oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
(Oh-oh-oh)

It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips
No tender touches please
I'd rather die on my two feet
Than live down on my knees

And all because you get me
Opened up and start to bleed, yeah
And I just can't get over you
Until you're over me

I can't refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
(Oh-oh-oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
(Oh-oh-oh)

And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
(Oh-oh-oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care
(Oh-oh-oh)

It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl I'm still in love with you
